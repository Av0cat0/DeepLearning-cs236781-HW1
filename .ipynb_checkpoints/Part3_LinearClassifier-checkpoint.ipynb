    "- $\\mat{X}$ is a matrix of shape $N\\times (D+1)$ containing $N$ samples in it's rows;\n",

The model is slightly overfitted to the training set, we can conclude that from investigating the loss function: we can see that after only a few iterations the test loss  > training loss, meaning we're training our model in such complexity that the model focusing on decreasing the train samples loss, resulting in a better loss for the training sets instead of the test set. we can also conclude that from the accuracy graph: the train set accuracy is high while the test set is not that good, that means the model focused a bit too much on training instead of validating. the model is not highly overfitting because if it was, the accuracy of the test set was much lower because of training the model for the specific training sample.\n",
